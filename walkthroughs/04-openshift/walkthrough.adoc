= Lab 4 - Publish to OpenShift

Learn how to deploy integrations using the tools available for OpenShift.

There are several ways to deploy an application into OpenShift, the most common are:

- Directly from the git repository using S2I
- From the local machine using binary deployment
- From a Docker image

For this lab we will start with the binary deployment option, uploading the binary directly from the IDE workspace to OpenShift.
For it to work we will need the `oc` client that is installed in the environment.

In the last section you will see how to use S2I to deploy applications, a way to deploy application using git repositories.

== MySQL Database provisioning

First, to work with the MySQL database we have to deploy/provision it.

Go to the link:{openshift-host}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
On the *Developer* view, click on *Add*  on the left menu:

== Application deployment to OpenShift using Binary Deployment

Before using the `oc` maven plugin, first we need to log in OpenShift.
On the right side panel, click on the `log in openshift` command:

{empty} +

Once the login process is done, you should see a similar message:

image::./images/lab05-after-login.png[]

{empty} +

Now that you are logged in, on the right panel, click on the `deploy to openshift` command.
This command you build the project locally and push it to OpenShift, where a container image will be created.

The `openshift` maven profile uses the k8s authentication configuration present in the user home.
It also uses a binary deployment, meaning it builds your application binary locally and sends the resulting jar to OpenShift to "wrap" in a container image and deploy it.

After the deployment completes, you will see that the application is using both the AMQ Broker / Kafka and the MySQL database deployed on OpenShift.
All production configuration data is in the `src/main/resources/application-prod.properties` file and Qiuarkus is activating this profile during the deployment.
oc will inject this content inside of the final DeploymentConfig when deploying to OpenShift.
