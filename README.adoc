== Requirements

=== OpenShift 4.10

This workshops requires a OpenShift environment with users already defined, they must:

- be named as `user + number`, like `user1`
- have the same password: `openshift`.

Have as many as you need for your activity.

Take the above resource consumption as a base to calculate the amount of resource you will need for your workshop.

NOTE: This workshop is specifically tested with OCP 4.10. Older versions have API incompatibilities that will break the automation and newer versions still not possess some of the operators used in this workshop.

=== Resource Consumption per User

=== Openshift Dev Spaces (old CodeReady Workspaces)

You just need an updated browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox :)

== Using the Ansible playbook
